NAME
    Perl::Critic::logicLAB - a set of Perl::Critic policies implemented and
    used by logicLAB

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        % perlcritic --theme logiclab

DESCRIPTION
    Perl::Critic::logicLAB is not a distribution of policies, it is more of
    a meta-package, implemented like the Task distributions.

    This is not the recommended way of doing things, but it does offer the
    following benefits:

    * Policies can be released separately
    * Policies can be released without association with
    Perl::Critic::logicLAB until their value and correctness has been
    asserted
    * You can write a meta-package, listing the policies you want on a
    policy by policy level, using the same schema

POLICIES
    Currently Perl::Critic::logicLAB consists of the following policies.

    * Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::ProhibitUseLib
    * Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::RequireVersionFormat

CONFIGURATION
    Please see the separate polices for configuration.

DEPENDENCIES AND REQUIREMENTS
    None currently.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    This distribution holds no known incompatibilities.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
